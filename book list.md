# Book List

This is a list of book recommendations for studying mathematics and theoretical physics.

:raised_hand: **Disclaimer**:

- :atom_symbol: recommendations are made for people who are studying *mathematics and theoretical physics*, and they will probably give a bad advice for those from other STEM fields (since they will be too mathematical and abstract for this audience)
- :green_salad: book selection describes *my personal taste* and does not imply any objective judgement about how one should study physics and mathematics
- :books: most books in the list are *graduate level books* (so many of them better be read with some prior knowledge of the subject in question)
